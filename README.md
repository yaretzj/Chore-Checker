# Chore Center

## Overview

Chores aren't fun, and parents often struggle to provide incentives for their children to complete chores. Chore Center is a mobile application that gamifies the task of completing chores for children. Parents can easily create chores for their children to complete in the app and assign points for each chore. The points are awarded to the child once the chore is complete, and can be redeemed for rewards defined by the parents.
