- ### Yixiao
    - #### Past Goals
        - Add more tests and handlings of edge cases by May 30th.
        - General maintenance of the mobile app to improve user experience by May 30th.

    - #### Progress and Issues
        - **Progress**
            - Added documentation, comments in frontend code.
            - Implemented alert dialogs in many of the activities to pop up messages and confirmations of action.
            - Updated Espresso instrumented testing.

        - **Issues**
            - The instrumented testing appears to be nondeterministic due to the fact that the emulator operating system may schedule the testing checks before a view pops up on the screen because the activities are asynchronous network requests that are handled in some other threads and take nondeterministic time to complete. The current solution is to add more delay to the checks and the result has become much more stable.
