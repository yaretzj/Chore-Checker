# Android User Interface

First, clone the top level repository to a local directory. Next, use Android Studio to 'Open an Existing Project' from 'ChoreCenterApp' directory under the 'Android' directory.
The development team used Android Studio with SDK of version 29. The minimum version of the Android Operating System required to run the app is set to be SDK 21 (Lollipop) which has 94.1% of the market share. After opening the project, Android Studio should allow for building and running the app on an emulator with Android version at least Lollipop.
